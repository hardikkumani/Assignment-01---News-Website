    <p>Donald Trump’s return to power with the greatest support that he has had since his political debut is a vindication of his philosophy to not fold</p>
    <p>Donald Trump has pulled off a modern political miracle. His return to the White House is a story about American society, but it is also a story of Trump’s political resilience.</p>
    <p>No other leader in any democracy, let alone a democracy of the complexity, history and sophistication of the United States, has ever done what Trump has done in the last nine years. He is the only person since Franklin D. Roosevelt who has been a nominee of a major party for president thrice in a row. He is the only former American president who, after a criminal conviction, not just won his party’s nomination but has also won the national elections yet again, with an even bigger margin. And he is the only leader who has taken over one of the two major parties and completely reshaped its ideological worldview and political base.</p>
